st.write("""Fetchly is a modular, all-in-one web application that brings together the latest tech articles, trending movies, and remote job listings into a single dashboard. Built with Python, Streamlit, Plotly, and BeautifulSoup, Fetchly helps users explore data from multiple sources in a clean, interactive interface.

Unlike traditional scrapers that only dump raw text, Fetchly is designed to go a step further:

ðŸ“° Tech Articles â†’ Stay up to date with the latest developments in the tech industry. View articles in a clean format, explore raw data, or analyze overall trends such as word frequencies and sentiment.

ðŸŽ¬ Trending Movies â†’ See whatâ€™s popular in film today using external APIs. Explore movie posters, ratings, and analytics like genre breakdowns and average ratings.

ðŸ’¼ Remote Job Listings â†’ Browse jobs scraped from reputable job boards (like WeWorkRemotely). Filter by contract type (Full-Time/Contract), analyze job type distribution, and view salary insights where available.

Fetchly also includes analytics and visualization features powered by Plotly, transforming raw scraped data into meaningful insights. Whether youâ€™re exploring tech trends, planning your next movie night, or job-hunting, Fetchly centralizes it all in one intuitive app.""")
